# EE 175: Senior Design Project

## Course Overview

EE 175A/B is a two-sequence course designed to provide students with hands-on experience in the design, development, and testing of electrical engineering devices or systems. Under the direction of an instructor, students will propose, build, and refine projects while considering technical specifications, design constraints, industry standards, ethical responsibilities, and the broader impacts of technology.

## Course Structure

### Sequence I: Proposal and Design

In EE 175A, students will focus on the conceptualization and planning phases of their projects. Key activities include:

- **Proposal Development:** Students will propose the design of electrical engineering devices or systems, guided by the instructor.
- **Technical Specification:** Detailed technical specifications for the project will be developed, taking into account all relevant design constraints and industry standards.
- **Ethical Responsibilities:** Emphasis will be placed on understanding and integrating ethical considerations into the design process.
- **Technology Awareness:** Students will be encouraged to stay current with technological advancements and consider the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of their designs.

### Sequence II: Build, Test, and Redesign

In EE 175B, students focus on the practical implementation and refinement of the proposed designs. Key activities include:

- **Building and Testing:** Students will build and test their electrical engineering devices or systems according to the design specifications.
- **Test Plan Development:** A comprehensive test plan will be developed and executed to ensure the design meets all specified requirements.
- **Redesign and Optimization:** Based on test results, students will make necessary modifications to optimize their designs.
- **Project Demonstration:** A demo of the final design will be presented, showcasing the functionality and performance of the project.
- **Technical Documentation:** Complete project testing and technical documentation will be prepared, providing a detailed record of the design and development process.
